Class description: In this class, we will discuss how large scale structures from inflationary perturbations, and how galaxies form in relation to the cosmic web. We will also discuss various probes of the large scale structure such as galaxy clustering, and gravitational lensing. Finally, this class will cover models for establishing the connection between galaxies and dark matter halos, such as abundance matching and halo occupation distribution models. An emphasis will be placed on discussing recent advancements in this field.
